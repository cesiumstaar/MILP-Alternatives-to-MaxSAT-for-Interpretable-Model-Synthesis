# MILP-Alternatives-to-MaxSAT-for-Interpretable-Model-Synthesis
This project, completed for CS781: Formal Methods in ML (Fall 2025), explores MILP-based alternatives to MaxSAT for synthesizing interpretable decision diagrams. It reproduces the original encoding, analyzes its issues, and develops more efficient MILP/IP formulations under richer structural constraints.
